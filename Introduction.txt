1.List of classes.
        1.Graph
        2.Cell
        3.Vertex
        4.Edge
        5.Stack
        6.Queue
        7.DrawingDFS
        8.DawingBFS

2.The Graph class contains the main method.

3.Working
    -Give an input n: Eg. 4
    -a 4x4 matrix Maze is created(using BFS). Also the solution to the Maze is determined(DFS) 
    -Valid input of n is 0-7.
    - on clicking the same n you can get randomly new maze's.
